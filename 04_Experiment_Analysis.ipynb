    "#### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few weeks of the seminar are used to get into the idea of motor control. A good way to learn is also to experience the stimuli and action in the field of human perception and action. Therefore, the first weeks are focussed on doing a simple pointing task in different conditions, very losely based on Fitts' paper from the 1950's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitts, P.M. (1954). The Information Capacity of the Human Motor System in Controlling the Amplitude of Movement. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 47(6), 381-391.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitts' observed that moving horizontally between two targets depended on the width of the targets and the distance between them. Fitts only looked at one-dimensional movements. In the experiment for the Handeln course we will explore how 2D-movements might depend on such parameters as e.g. target shape. More particularly we will investigate if the movements will remain straight movements to the centre of the target or not. For this we will need to analyse the trajectories of the movements depending on target shape and any other parameters of interest in the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements before starting to work in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be looking at the analysis of movement data. **Before starting to work on this notebook you should have:** \n",
    "- installed the required conda environment\n",
    "- run the little experiment on yourself (best using a graphics tablet or computer mouse, but failing that a track pad), as you will be working on your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do let us know if you have trouble running the experiment. We can then have a look at why this might be so (sometimes different systems respond differently to the same code), and in the worst case we can provide you with a default dataset to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for the experiment should be stored in a folder called `data`. In this notebook we will be taking a look at the data and investigate whether the different conditions led to different movement trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is important to realise that using a computer mouse in the experiment has its caveats. For instance how much a cursor moves across a computer screen does not depend in a one-to-one fashion on how far the mouse is moved in physical space, but also on the speed with which the physical mouse is moved. You can try this out for yourself:  \n",
    "- mark a begin and end point of your movement in physical space (e.g. put 2 pieces of tape on your desk).\n",
    "- make sure that the cursor has enough space on the screen to move (e.g. if you are planning to move from left to right, place the cursor on the left end of the screen).\n",
    "- then move slowly from the beginning marker to the end marker in physical phase and check how much the cursor moved on the screen (this will be a relatively small amount).\n",
    "- repeat the above two steps but now make a fast movement from beginning to end marker, end again check the distance traveled by the cursor on the screen (this should now have moved to a much larger extent).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this it should be evident that in the literature, when it comes to the study of visuomotor control, it is hardly ever the case that computer mouses are used in the experimental task. At the very least this is something to be aware of when planning actual experiments. For the purpose of this course we will however be largely ignoring this, but just so you know that some of the results, particularly for this demo experiment, might have to be taken with a grain of salt."
